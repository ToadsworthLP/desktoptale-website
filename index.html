        <h1>- WHAT? -</h1>
        Desktoptale is a tiny program that puts a fully controllable Undertale Yellow character (Clover, Martlet, Starlo, Ceroba or Axis) on your Windows desktop!<br>
        You can either move them yourself (see CONTROLS section below) or just leave them be, in which case they'll start walking around on their own.
        <h1>- SETUP -</h1>
        <ol>

            <li>Extract its contents to any folder</li>
            <li>Run Desktoptale.exe</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>- CONTROLS -</h1>
        <ul>

        <h1>- FAQ -</h1>
        <div class="faq-question">
            Q: Windows gives me a scary looking warning when trying to run the program!
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            A: It just says that not many people have run it before and that the code is unsigned.
            There should be a link somewhere saying something like "More info" which causes a "Run anyway" button to appear somewhere at the bottom of the warning screen.
        </div>
        <div class="faq-question">
            Q: It doesn't work!
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            A: There's a decent chance you don't have .NET Framework 4.8 installed.
            It should be coming bundled with Windows, but downloading it from
            <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft's download page over here</a>
            should fix it (you just need the runtime, NOT the developer pack).
        </div>
        <div class="faq-question">
            Q: It still doesn't work! / The application crashes or behaves weirdly!
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            A: You might've found a bug! Please contact me on Twitter (@ToadsworthLP) or Discord (toadsworthlp) so I can fix it.
